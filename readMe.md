### Introduction:

This project aims to predict the Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the National Basketball Association (NBA) using data analysis and linear regression. The project utilizes Python libraries such as NumPy and Pandas to analyze and manipulate data, and then uses linear regression to make predictions.

### Requirements:

To run this project, you will need to have the following installed:

- Python 3
- NumPy
- Pandas
- scikit-learn
- requests
- beautiful soup
- selenium

### Data:

The data used in this project is sourced from the NBA's official website and includes statistics for all players who played in the league during the 2019-2020 season. The data includes various player statistics such as points per game, rebounds per game, assists per game, and more.

Instructions:

1. Download or clone the project repository.
2. Install the required libraries using pip or conda.
3. Run the 'main.py' file to execute the program.
4. The program will load the data, clean and preprocess it, and then use linear regression to predict the MVP.

### Output:

The output of the program will be a predicted MVP for the 2019-2020 NBA season based on the player statistics analyzed by the program.

### Conclusion:

This project demonstrates how data analysis and machine learning techniques can be used to make predictions in sports. By using Python libraries such as NumPy and Pandas, we were able to analyze and manipulate data, and then use linear regression to make predictions. This project can be extended to include more advanced machine learning techniques or to predict other sports awards.
